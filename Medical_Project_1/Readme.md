# AI Symptom Checker

The AI Symptom Checker is a research-driven application designed to assist users in understanding their health concerns by analyzing reported symptoms and suggesting possible medical conditions. Unlike generic web searches, which often lead to misinformation, this system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and medical knowledge bases to provide evidence-based insights. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured symptom–disease mappings, the AI Symptom Checker offers a ranked list of potential conditions, supported by citations from trusted sources such as PubMed, WHO, and clinical guidelines. While not a substitute for professional diagnosis, it serves as an educational and research tool that empowers users to make informed decisions and facilitates further exploration for clinicians, students, and researchers in the medical field.

Nice — I’ll walk you through a **detailed, practical blueprint** for the **AI Symptom Checker (Research/Education Focus)** so you can design, build, test, and publish it as a research-quality project and portfolio piece.

I’ll cover: product goals, architecture, data sources, models & training, databases & schemas, example API endpoints, UX/flows, evaluation & research methodology, safety/ethics/regulatory, deployment & MLOps, and a 6-week roadmap with milestones.

# 1) Product goals (what success looks like)

* Let a user enter symptoms (free text + structured options).
* Return a ranked list of **possible conditions** with short plain-language explanations.
* For each condition, show **links to trustworthy sources** (PubMed abstracts, WHO pages, clinical guidelines).
* Provide **confidence scores** and recommended next steps (self-care vs. see clinician vs. emergency).
* Be explicitly **educational** — not a final diagnosis; include strong disclaimers.
* Allow researchers/clinicians to run batch evaluations and export logs for analysis (consent required).

---

# 2) High-level architecture

Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind) ⇄ Backend API (FastAPI) ⇄ Services:

* LLM service (OpenAI / private HuggingFace model) + few-shot/fine-tuned models
* Symptom–disease graph (Neo4j) for structured reasoning and explainability
* Relational DB (Postgres) for users, sessions, logs, consent, feedback
* Vector DB (FAISS / Pinecone) for retrieval of relevant papers & clinical guidance
* Worker queue (Redis + Celery) for async tasks (paper retrieval, batch evaluation)
* Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) + logging (ELK / Sentry)
  Optionally: Docker + Kubernetes for scaling

---

# 3) Data sources (what to use & where to get it)

* **Clinical reference / guidelines**: WHO, CDC pages, NICE guidelines (for links & authoritative text snippets).
* **Research papers / abstracts**: PubMed / PubMed Central / arXiv (for biomedical literature retrieval).
* **Medical knowledge bases**: SNOMED CT, ICD-10 (for canonical condition codes — licensing may apply), DrugBank for interactions.
* **Open datasets for training/eval**: MIMIC (clinical notes, requires credentialing), MedNLI (natural language inference in clinical domain), clinical QA datasets, symptom-disease mappings from validated sources or open datasets on Kaggle.
* **User data** (consented): anonymized logs, clinician-verified labels for evaluation.

> Note: always check licensing and access controls (e.g., MIMIC needs credentialing & data use agreement).

---

# 4) Models & AI design (how the reasoning works)

Use a **hybrid retrieval + generative** pattern for accuracy and evidence:

1. **Retrieval**:

   * Convert user input into embeddings (OpenAI embeddings or HuggingFace sentence-transformers).
   * Query a vector DB (papers, clinical guidelines, symptom descriptions) to retrieve top-k evidence passages.

2. **Symbolic / Graph reasoning**:

   * Use Neo4j graph to match symptom nodes → candidate conditions via known relationships (symptom→disease edges with weights).
   * Graph provides explainability: show which symptom→condition edges contributed.

3. **LLM fusion**:

   * Feed the LLM: user text + retrieved evidence + graph-suggested conditions as context.
   * LLM outputs: ranked conditions, plain-language summaries, confidence, supporting citations (paper titles/URLs + passages).

4. **Optional fine-tuning**:

   * Fine-tune smaller LMs on medical QA / symptom → diagnosis pairs (only with high-quality, labelled data).
   * Use RLHF sparingly and with clinician oversight if you go that route.

**Model choices**:

* Production LLM: OpenAI GPT family for strong reasoning + up-to-date retrieval (or a tuned Llama / Mistral on HuggingFace if you prefer open models).
* Embeddings: OpenAI embeddings or MPNET / SBERT from HuggingFace.
* Image models (if adding photos): DenseNet/CheXNet-style pre-trained models for chest X-rays (only if you have image data & approvals).

---

# 5) Database & schema (Postgres + Neo4j suggestion)

### Postgres (users, sessions, logs)

* users (id, anon_id, consent_flag, created_at)
* sessions (id, user_id, started_at, ended_at)
* queries (id, session_id, raw_text, processed_text, timestamp)
* results (id, query_id, condition_code, condition_name, rank, confidence, explanation_snippet)
* feedback (id, result_id, feedback_type, notes, timestamp)

### Neo4j (knowledge graph)

* Nodes: Symptom {name, code}, Condition {name, ICD10, prevalence}, Sign {name}
* Edges: (Symptom)-[INDICATES {weight, evidence_refs}]->(Condition)
* Index common symptom strings (alternate names)

### Vector DB (papers/guidelines)

* Each document: doc_id, title, source, url, passage_text, embedding

---

# 6) Example API endpoints (FastAPI)

* `POST /api/v1/diagnose` — body: `{ user_id?, session_id?, symptoms_text, age?, sex?, comorbidities? }` → returns top-k conditions with confidence, citations, recommended next steps.
* `GET /api/v1/paper/{id}` — returns paper metadata & passage.
* `POST /api/v1/feedback` — store user/clinician feedback (correct/incorrect/uncertain).
* `GET /api/v1/session/{id}/export` — export session for clinician review (CSV/JSON).

(Implement rate limiting, auth, and logging.)

---

# 7) UX & user flows

* **Entry screen**: quick symptom form + “describe in your own words” text area + structured checkboxes (fever, pain, duration, onset).
* **Safety triage first**: screen for emergency red flags (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing) — if present, show emergency advice immediately (call emergency services).
* **Results screen**: ranked list (3–5) with:

  * condition name + short 1–2 sentence plain-language description
  * confidence score (0–100%)
  * supporting citations (PubMed abstract links + snippets)
  * recommended next step (self-care / see GP within X days / emergency)
  * “Why this?” expandable: shows graph edges and retrieved evidence
* **Feedback**: “Was this helpful?” with option to flag incorrect suggestions (used for retraining/validation).
* **Clinician mode**: allows clinician to review logs, annotate, and provide gold labels.

---

# 8) Evaluation & research methodology (how to prove it works)

**Metrics**

* Top-1, Top-3 accuracy (does the true diagnosis appear in top-k?)
* Precision, recall, F1 for condition prediction
* Calibration (are confidence scores well-calibrated?)
* Explainability assessment: clinician-rated explanation usefulness (Likert scale)
* Safety checks: false negative rate for emergencies

**Evaluation datasets**

* Use held-out clinical notes (MIMIC if accessible) or synthetic test sets curated with clinicians.
* Run a user study: recruit clinicians to label a sample (e.g., 500 cases) and compare model outputs vs. clinician labels.

**A/B studies**

* Randomize users between baseline (no evidence shown) vs. evidence-backed outputs to measure trust and correctness.

**Research paper potential**

* Compare system performance to heuristic symptom checkers or other published systems; submit findings to a conference or preprint (e.g., arXiv).

---

# 9) Safety, ethics, and regulation

* Always **disclaim**: educational tool — not a diagnosis. Prominently display this.
* **Privacy**: encrypt PHI at rest & in transit. Prefer **de-identification** and store minimal personal data; log with consent.
* **HIPAA / GDPR**: If you expect U.S. patients or EU residents, design for compliance (data processing agreements, data subject rights).
* **Clinical validation**: don’t market as medical device without proper regulatory clearance (FDA, CE). Keep project research/educational.
* **Bias monitoring**: evaluate across age, sex, ethnicity to detect systematic errors.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: include clinician review for uncertain/high-risk cases.

---

# 10) Deployment & MLOps

* Containerize services (Docker), orchestrate with Kubernetes if scaling.
* Use CI/CD: Github Actions for tests, model packaging, and infra deployment.
* Model rollout: shadow deploy new models, compare metrics, then promote.
* Monitoring: track latency, error rates, model drift (data distribution), user feedback trends.
* Retraining pipeline: periodic re-training using clinician-labeled data and high-quality feedback.

---

# 11) Explainability & transparency features (important for medical domain)

* Show **source snippets** used to make each suggestion.
* Show **graph path** (Symptom → Edge weight → Condition) so clinicians can inspect reasoning.
* Provide **confidence intervals** and uncertainty flags.
* Let users **export** session to share with clinicians.

---

# 12) Example LLM prompt recipe (retrieval-augmented)

Use this pattern when you call the LLM:

```
SYSTEM: You are a medical research assistant. Use only the evidence provided below and conservative clinical reasoning. Provide ranked possible conditions with confidence (0-100), 1-2 sentence plain English summary, and cite supporting evidence.

USER: Patient: 36-year-old female. Symptoms: "fever and cough for 3 days, mild shortness of breath, no chest pain". Past history: asthma. Age:36, Sex:F.

EVIDENCE: 
1) [Passage A from WHO guideline about acute respiratory infection... (url)]
2) [PubMed abstract: "Viral vs bacterial pneumonia indicators..." (url)]
3) [Graph hints: Symptom 'shortness of breath' -> Condition 'pneumonia' (weight:0.7)]

INSTRUCTION: Return top 3 conditions with reasons and citations. If emergency signs are present, prioritize triage. End with "This is an educational tool, seek clinician advice."
```

Tune the LLM temperature low (0–0.3) for deterministic outputs. Use structured JSON output for parsability.

---

# 13) Privacy, logging & consent UI

* Present a short consent modal before collecting symptoms for research use.
* Allow users to opt out of data collection; separate anonymous mode.
* Store identifiable data only if necessary and with explicit consent.

---

# 14) 6-week build & research roadmap (practical)

Week 1 — Discovery & data:

* Collect symptom-disease mappings, select sources (WHO, PubMed).
* Build initial Neo4j graph seed (common conditions).

Week 2 — Core backend + retrieval:

---

## Final practical next step

If you want, I can:

* generate the **FastAPI skeleton** (routes + models) and a **Next.js starter UI** for the MVP, or
* produce a **Neo4j schema + Cypher seed script** to create the initial symptom→condition graph, or
* prepare a **data-collection template** (CSV schema) for gathering 500 clinical vignettes for evaluation.

Which of those would you like me to produce right now?
