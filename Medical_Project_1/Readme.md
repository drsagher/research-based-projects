# AI Symptom Checker

The AI Symptom Checker is a research-driven application designed to assist users in understanding their health concerns by analyzing reported symptoms and suggesting possible medical conditions. Unlike generic web searches, which often lead to misinformation, this system integrates natural language processing (NLP) and medical knowledge bases to provide evidence-based insights. By combining large language models (LLMs) with structured symptomâ€“disease mappings, the AI Symptom Checker offers a ranked list of potential conditions, supported by citations from trusted sources such as PubMed, WHO, and clinical guidelines. While not a substitute for professional diagnosis, it serves as an educational and research tool that empowers users to make informed decisions and facilitates further exploration for clinicians, students, and researchers in the medical field.
